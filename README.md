# Distributed Architecture of Software
[Distributed Architecture](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1631/jzus.2005.A0513.pdf)

This is more like a research paper concerning Software Development. The paper describes one kind of distributed software architecture framework. I do not understand this paper quite much but I think distributed software development frameworks is an important topic for all software engineers. 

These days, almost all companies start to provide their software and websites to everyone around the world. Centralized Architecture, namely something I am going to develop in this class, shows its drawbacks. For example, once the single machine holding the software accepts too many requests, it will blow up, and everyone cannot use the software. This will in turn bring great losses to the company. However, if several different machines are running different modules, even if one machine may fail, other machines can keep running its module and even if all machines running one module fail, other modules can still operate.

#### Comment by Pengfan:
I agree with Peiqi. Nowadays everything is trying to be decentralized, so distributed software development may be the future too. I believe these frameworks will simplify our work to develop softwares which have distributed architectures.
